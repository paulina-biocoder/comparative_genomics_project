# Comparative Genomics Project

## Overview
This repository contains the final project for the Comparative Genomics course. Due to the language of instruction, all project materials, documentation, and analysis are presented in Polish.

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to conduct comparative genomics analyses using mitochondrial genomes and selected mitochondrial gene sequences. Our research focused on the **Felidae** family (cats), examining evolutionary relationships within this group.

The project is based on:
- 10 mitochondrial genomes from various feline species.
- At least 80 sequences of selected mitochondrial genes (e.g., cytB, COX genes, ND genes), with a maximum of 8 sequences per species.

## Required Analyses
The project consists of the following analyses:
1. **Comparative Analysis of 10 Mitochondrial Genomes**
   - Conducted using the CCT Comparison Tool.

2. **Phylogenetic Analysis of 80 Mitochondrial Gene Sequences**
   - Performed using software introduced during the course.
   - The phylogenetic tree is rooted using sequences from an external group of animals. In our case, we used **canids** (e.g., wolves and foxes) as an outgroup to compare with felids.

## Documentation and Reporting
- Each step of the analysis must be documented, including screenshots where applicable.
- The results should be discussed and compared with findings from other authors.
- The final project must be submitted as a single PDF file via the Classroom system by the end of the semester.

## Additional Points
Bonus points will be awarded for:
- Comparing the obtained results with findings from other researchers.
- Providing a thorough discussion of the results beyond basic observations.

## Authors
This project was developed as part of the Comparative Genomics course, focusing on the evolutionary analysis of Felidae.
